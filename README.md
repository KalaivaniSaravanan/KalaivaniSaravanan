Hi, I'm Kalaivani Saravanan, a passionate QA professional with a drive for continuous learning and delivering high-quality software solutions.
My journey in tech has been filled with opportunities to shape efficient testing processes and collaborate across diverse teams.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on leading QA efforts in cloud-based CRM and ERP solutions, especially in projects like Paywize, where Iâ€™ve developed automated test scripts 
using Python and Robot Framework, ensuring seamless client management and financial operations.
ðŸŒ± ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m actively learning Software Testing Automation using Robot Framework at Metropolia's open university of applied sciences, and seeking new opportunities in software testing to apply my extensive knowledge of manual and automated testing across industries.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge my skills in test automation and quality assurance, while also exploring innovative tools like 
Generative AI for enhanced testing workflows.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with breaking into more advanced test automation frameworks and exploring opportunities in cutting-edge tech projects.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about QA methodologies, Agile practices, or how to leverage ClickUp, Jeera and other project management tools for efficient cross-functional team collaboration.

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not testing software, I'm a certified Yoga trainer and love exploring how mindfulness can improve focus and problem-solving in tech!
