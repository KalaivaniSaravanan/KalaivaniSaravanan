Hi, I'm Kalaivani Saravanan, a passionate QA professional with a drive for continuous learning and delivering high-quality software solutions.
My journey in tech has been filled with opportunities to shape efficient testing processes and collaborate across diverse teams.

🔭 I’m currently working on leading QA efforts in cloud-based CRM and ERP solutions, especially in projects like Paywize, where I’ve developed automated test scripts 
using Python and Robot Framework, ensuring seamless client management and financial operations.
🌱 I’m actively seeking new opportunities in software testing where I can apply my extensive knowledge of manual and automated testing across industries such as
finance and healthcare.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge my skills in test automation and quality assurance, while also exploring innovative tools like 
Generative AI for enhanced testing workflows.
🤔 I’m looking for help with breaking into more advanced test automation frameworks and exploring opportunities in cutting-edge tech projects.
💬 Ask me about QA methodologies, Agile practices, or how to leverage ClickUp, Jeera and other project management tools for efficient cross-functional team collaboration.

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not testing software, I'm a certified Yoga trainer and love exploring how mindfulness can improve focus and problem-solving in tech!
